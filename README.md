# W2 Homework: Google Clone!

This week, you're going to be building a clone of the Google home page, one of the mostly visited pages in the world. Google itself is a successful company popular for it's highly efficient searched engine built with a meticulous algorithm.

**The challenge is to get as far as you can in 3 hours!**

This will test:

- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub

## You Will Build

+ Create the exact replica of the Google Home Page so that if we cannot tell the difference between the original and the copy when we look at it. 

+ Remember, you are NOT being asked to implement the functionality of the Google Home Page, but **only the interface + layout** (using HTML and CSS). 

+ For this challenge, do not open the chrome developer tools or download the html page. In order to get the most out of this challenge, you should develop the page from scratch.


## Do's and Don'ts

+ We have an "index.html" file and a "style.css" file, which you will be working on. Do all your HTML works in "index.html" and all your styling (CSS works) in "style.css". 

+ We also have an `/imgs` directory, in case you want to store any images to use on your Google Clone (aka Google logo, etc.).  We left you some logos to use if you'd like; you're welcome to find some on your own too!

+ DO NOT add any more files or use any JavaScript codes for this challenge. 

## Testing

To test your progress and see your work in the browser - simply navigate to your project directory + open `index.html`

Good Luck!
